# Data Visualization on Exchange Rates: Turning Risks into Opportunities

## Introduction
This project focuses on the explanatory data visualization of the foreign exchange rate (FX-rate) between the euro (â‚¬) and the United States dollar (\\$).

In the case of the EURO-USD exchange rate, the higher the rate, the stronger the value of the euro, and *vice versa*. For example, the euro is stronger at the exchange rate of 1.60 compared to 0.83, as one pays 1 euro to get 1.60 USD instead of 0.83 USD.

We use a dataset of euro daily exchange rates from 1999-01-04 to 2021-01-08, which was compiled and published by Daria Chemkaeva on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/lsind18/euro-exchange-daily-rates-19992020). It is noteworthy that the dataset is updated regularly, and we are using the dataset downloaded in January 2021. The data was originally from the European Central Bank.

### Project goals
This project aims to illustrate the evolution of the EURO-USD exchange rate from 1999 to 2021 via storytelling data visualisation.

### Scopes
The project scopes include:

- Data cleaning
- Storytelling data visualisations

### Key results
**EURO-USD FX-rate bottomed between 2000-2001** (during the 2000s recession) and **peaked in 2008** (during the financial crisis).

**The Euro currency has been weak since 2015** due to multiple reasons, such as the European Central Bank's quantitative easing programme, the deepening of the European sovereign debt crisis, the likelihood of an increase in US interest rates, the 2019 global economic slowdown and the Covid-19 recession.
